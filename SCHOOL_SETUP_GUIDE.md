## 🌟 What is Open Syllabus?

Open Syllabus is an AI-powered educational platform that helps teachers create custom AI tutors for their students. Think of it as having a teaching assistant available 24/7 who:

- ✅ Knows your exact curriculum and teaching style
- ✅ Provides safe, age-appropriate help to students
- ✅ Never gives direct answers but guides learning
- ✅ Alerts teachers if students need help
- ✅ Tracks learning progress automatically

### Real Examples from Schools

- **Elementary School Math**: Mrs. Johnson created "Math Buddy" that helps 3rd graders with multiplication using the same methods taught in class
- **High School History**: Mr. Chen's "History Helper" discusses World War II using only approved textbook materials
- **Middle School Science**: Ms. Garcia's "Lab Assistant" helps students understand experiments and write lab reports
