# Safety Feature Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of the safety message system in ClassBots. The system monitors student messages for concerning content and provides appropriate safety resources and helplines specific to their country.

## Key Components

1. **Safety Message Component**: 
   - Created a dedicated SafetyMessage component to display safety messages with appropriate styling
   - Used styled-components for consistent theming and visual distinction

2. **Safety Response Generation**:
   - Implemented `generateSafetyResponse` function that creates supportive safety messages with:
     - Concern-specific introductory text
     - Teacher awareness message
     - Country-specific helplines
     - Encouraging closing message

3. **Chat Component Integration**:
   - Updated Chat component to render safety messages using the dedicated SafetyMessage component
   - Maintained all existing functionality while adding the new safety message rendering

4. **Analytics Tracking**:
   - Added a safety_analytics table to track:
     - Safety message generation events
     - Student interactions with safety messages
     - Effectiveness of country-specific helplines

5. **Testing**:
   - Created tests to verify proper handling of safety messages
   - Tests check for correct country-specific helplines and concern-specific language

## How It Works

1. When a student sends a message, the system checks for keywords related to various concerns (self-harm, bullying, abuse, depression, family issues)

2. If keywords are detected, the message is analyzed to determine if it's a genuine concern and assess its severity level

3. For genuine concerns above the threshold level, the system:
   - Alerts the teacher via email
   - Generates a supportive safety message with country-specific helplines
   - Displays the safety message to the student in a visually distinct way
   - Tracks the interaction for analytics

4. The system ensures appropriate helplines are always provided by:
   - Using country codes to determine which helplines to show
   - Handling country code variations (e.g., UK → GB, USA → US)
   - Falling back to DEFAULT helplines when country-specific ones aren't available

## Database Changes

Added a new `safety_analytics` table to track:
- Safety message generation events
- Student interactions with safety messages
- Effectiveness of different helplines

## Future Enhancements

Possible future enhancements for this system:
- Add additional support resources beyond phone helplines
- Implement more sophisticated concern detection using AI
- Provide teacher dashboard analytics to monitor safety message effectiveness
- Add ability for students to directly request help through the system
